Uh-huh, uh-huh (Yeah, Rihanna)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Good Girl Gone Bad)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Take three, action)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Hov)
No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down like the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone, we Roc-A-Fella
We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better
You know me (You know me)
In anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day
Jayâ€”Rain Man is back
With Little Miss Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at?
